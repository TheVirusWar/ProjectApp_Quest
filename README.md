# ProjectApp_Quest

Project I created as an evaluation task for a job application. The time period was two days, and in total I think I worked on this 20-25 hours. I submit it here as I sent it,
even though there are things I would change, for example: load and save process could be reworked, a lot of code could be shorter and quite possibly simpler.

The function of the program, per request, is to load, edit, and save "projects". It's in quotations because it was not specified what a project exactly is, 
I believe it has been done this way to encourage different results from all candidates. The project needed to have an input folder and an output directory, 
a start and an end date, and content. The program needed to be able to save and load created projects, search through them with some customizable options, 
such as case-sensitivity, file size, and result occurrences.
Bonus points were given if the app had a 'Recent files' tab, and a 'Save' and 'Save as' options.


All in all, as I lack serious job experience, I'm happy how this project turned out. It does lack some things, and a lot could have been done better and cleaner, but considering
there was a time limit, I feel I proved that I can design, create, bugtest and bugfix an application in such a short period.
